1. Query the table and get the row, col, val of the associative array
temp = B('1,','1,')
str2num(Row(temp)) == 1 % ans = 1

2. In matlab delete table operation:
delete(T) T is the database binding to the table

3. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In mv.m function, the matrix A is very sparse, so we parallel the computation by splitting the columns of the matrix into work nodes.
In computeR.m function, the input matrix is dense, tall and thin, and the vector is very small, so we parallel the computation by splitting the rows of the matrix.
