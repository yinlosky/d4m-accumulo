%% This is the function for alph_i = v_i'.*v (two vectors dotproduct) // both vectors are dense.
%% Input: 
%%  	para1: 'lz_vpath'
%%	para2: vector 2
%%   	para3: Num of nodes in the graph
%% 	para4: Num of machines for parallelization
%% Output: 
%%      Return the value of dot_prodcut R
%%      dot_output table will be created and saved 
%% ------------This function requires some optimization for matrix partition and load balancing------
%% For now I am simply evenly splitting the columns among different processros

%% This is an embarassing parallel job, need attention for parallelization

% Two approaches for this embarassing parallel job, one is to multiply one pair once and then sum them up, the other is use iterator 
% Not sure which is faster!!! For now I am taking the first approach.
