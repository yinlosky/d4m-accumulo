%  Above will write NumOfMachines result in the temp table
%  Now we need read all of them and add them up into 
final = 0;
myDB;
temp = DB('dot_temp');
output = DB('dot_output');
for i = 1:NumOfMachines
	tempV = str2num(Val(temp(sprintf('%d,',i),'1,')));
	final = final + tempV;
end
 Result = Assoc('1,','1,',sprintf('%.15f,',final));
 put(output, Result);

dot_result =  str2num(Val(output('1,','1,')));
